This is my C library of useful functions.

PREREQ: autoconf, automake, autotools, libtool, m4

NOTES:
in the event that ltmain.sh could not be found when running ./configure or autoreconf, run libtoolize to regenerate it
* Good news is that the library works in windows and in linux but its crappy in Windows due to crappy shell support
